I had issues with lab machine being extremely laggy on collosions. All it does is show one explosion that pops up at a random location between respawn point and point of collision. I couldn't determine if it was my code or lag causing this...but i think its lag. The explosion will sometimes go off and sometimes won't(atleast to the eye).It also goes off really quickly when it occurs b/c of lag spike .Not sure how else to test could not get it running on windows. I'm hoping that it runs fine on your machines

Also, it appears only one explosion happens. Wasn't sure b/c of lag and lack of precise loading but i followed dr zordan's code for creating particles so I couldn't tell why it would do this

and the moon.png has some black out corners that will appear to be no contact but it is hitting the rect correctly just a blank space from the picture
